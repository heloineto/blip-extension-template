## Installation

To start your extension using this template, run the command below:

```shell
npm create blip-extension@latest
```

Then follow the prompts!

See [create-blip-extension](https://github.com/heloineto/create-blip-extension#readme) for more details on supported templates.

> If for some reason the command above doesn't work, simply cloning this repository should suffice.

## How to create your Blip extension

In this section, you will learn how to set up and develop a Blip extension.

> This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of JavaScript and React concepts,
> and know how to use the Blip platform.

### What exactly is a Blip extension?

In technical terms, A blip extension is simply a web application viewed as an iframe inside the Blip platform.
It can do everything a web app can, and also communicate with the main platform though the [iframe-message-proxy](https://github.com/takenet/iframe-message-proxy) API.

### Step 1: Setup

Begin by scaffolding your project following the instructions on the [installation section](#installation).

After running the development server, you will be able to see the extension running on http://localhost:3000/.

### Step 3: Using the Blip APIs

The Blip platform provide multiple API endpoints that allow you to communicate with the main platform.

See the utility functions inside `src/lib/iframe-messages` to get an idea of how that looks like.

You can look how to do a specific thing on the [Blip Documentation](https://docs.blip.ai/#introduction).

As I understand, not everything is fully documented. If you can't find what you want to do in the documentation, I would recommend asking around in the [Blip forum](https://forum.blip.ai/).

### Step 4: Using other APIs

As a web application, you can use any API you want, or develop your own.

Simply make HTTP requests inside your extension. [See how to do this in React](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect#fetching-data-with-effects).

### Step 5: Develop!

Now it's up to you. Build what you want to, and don't forget to submit it to the Blip Store once it's done. Happy coding!

## How to re-create this template
